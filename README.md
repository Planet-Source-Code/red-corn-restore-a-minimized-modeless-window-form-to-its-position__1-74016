## Restore a minimized modeless window form to its position


</div>

### Description

Restore a minimized modeless window form to its position.

I don't know if there is a same one in PSC.

You know, when a form is minimized and stay on the taskbar,

you cann't restore it by just call its show method.

You either cann't change its windowstate to vbNormal,

otherwise, its size will be changed.
